# Reinforcement Learning Specialization

[Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) consist of 4 courses:
1. [Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning)
2. [Sample-based Learning Methods](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sample-based-learning-methods)
3. [Prediction and Control with Function Approximation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-control-function-approximation)
4. [A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/complete-reinforcement-learning-system)
